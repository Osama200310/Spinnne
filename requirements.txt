# Python dependencies for detection and utilities
# Note: Picamera2 is installed via apt on Raspberry Pi OS, not pip.
# OpenCV is required for OpenCV-based detectors and annotations. Use the headless build to avoid GUI deps.
numpy>=1.24
opencv-python-headless>=4.8

# Raspberry Pi note:
# On Pi (aarch64/arm), if the pip wheel is not available or too heavy, prefer:
#   sudo apt install -y python3-opencv
# In that case, create your venv with --system-site-packages so it can see apt packages.

# Optional (only if you want the Ultralytics backend):
# ultralytics>=8.2.0
